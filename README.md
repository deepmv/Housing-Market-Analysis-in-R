# Housing-Market-Analysis-in-R
Boston Housing Market Analysis in R 

This project was a part of a Class project. The main goal of the course was to help students use R language to collect data store it in appropriate manner and setup a data retrieval system to work with the stored data. 

This project includes scraping of the data from target websites, cleaning of the data using R language and creating a data model of the retrieved data to store it in a mysql database and make use of the data for future project analysis. After storing data we applied linear regression to predict housing prices. This was inspired by Andrew Ng ML course on coursera.
